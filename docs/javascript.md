__NOTE__ from [freeCodeCamp](freecodecamp.org)

### Comment Your JavaScript Code

* Comments are lines of code that JavaScript will intentionally ignore.
* Leave notes for yourself and others who are reading your code.
* To leave an in-line comment.
  * `// This is an in-line comment.`
* To leave a multi-line comment beginning with `/*` and ending iwth `*/`.
  * `/* This is a 
multi-line comment */`

### Declare JavaScript Variables

* __Data__ is anything that is meaningful to the computer.
  * undefined
  * null
  * boolean
  * string
  * symbol
  * bigint
  * number
  * object
* Computer's need to be able to distinguish between numbers and strings, such as "12" and "123 dogs".  Whereas, "12" is a _number_, and "123 dogs" should be processed as a _string_.

* __Variables__ allow computers to store and manipulate data.
* Any of the above eight data types may be stored as a variable.
* Computer variables differ from mathematical variables in that they can store different values at different times.
* How do we declare variables?
  * By putting `var` in front of it.
  * Example: `var myName;`
* In JavaScript, we end statements with semicolons.
