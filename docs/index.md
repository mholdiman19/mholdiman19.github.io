# Welcome to ReadMyDocs

Greetings Visitors!

**WELCOME MESSAGE:**  I created this site to organize and backup commands, documentation and anything else I want to have accessible.  Please note that I attempted to give credit where applicable and this site is constantly updated.  Needless to say, sections are not exhaustive and are my notes while reading, watching videos or on-the-job experience and learning.  Thank you!

For full documentation visit [mkdocs.org](https://mkdocs.org).
