Using the upower command => upower -i /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_BAT0 ACPI Description: Shows battery status and other ACPI information from /proc and /sys file system. To check the battery => acpi -V To just see status => acpi To see the AC adapter information => acpi -a To show thermal information => acpi -t To show thermal information in Fahrenheit => acpi -tf You can browse the same information by going to => cd /proc/acpi/ and doing, ls -al Via Directory Description: Stores ACPI information about your first battery. Command => ls -l /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0 Via GUI Description: The GUI program for the gnome power management infrastructure. It allows users to visualize their power consumption of laptop hardware. Command => gnome-power-statistics How To Use Workspaces Open the Activies Window Use Control+Alt+Up to move to the workspace shown above the current workspace in the workspace selector. Use Control+Alt+Down to move to the workspace shown below the current workspace in the workspace selector. How To Remove Directories & Files in Linux You can use the Gnome GUI You can delete directories using rmdir , rm and find NOTE You can recover files when you delete them using the GUI, but not when using the command line. To delete a directory in Linux filesystems, you are required to have write permission on the directory and its contents. If not, you will get \"Operation Not Permitted\" error. Directory names with a space in them must be escated with a backslash / . Removing Directories with rmdir To remove a directory, you can use the rmdir command line utility for deleting empty directories. Type the command followed by the name of the directory you want to remove. rmdir <directory name> If the directory is not empty, you will receive the following error: rmdir: failed to remove <directory name>: No such file or directory In the above case you will need to use the rm command or manually remove the directory contents before you delete the directory using rmdir . By default, when used without an option rm does not remove directories. Removing Directories with rm Link to Article rm is a command-line utility for deleting files and directories. Unlike rmdir the rm can delete both empty and non-empty directories. By default, when used without any option rm does not remove directories. To delete and empty directory, use the -d (--dir) option and to delete a non-empty directory, and all of its contents use the -r (--recursive or -R) option. To delete a directory with all of its contents you would type: rm -r <directory name> If a directory or a file within the directory is write-protected, you will be prompted to confirm the deletion. To remove a directory without being prompted, use the -f option. rm -rf <directory name> 10 Handy SystemD Commands: A Reference Link to Article From systemd man page => a unit file is a plain text inistyle file that encodes information about a service, a socket, a device, a mount point, an automount point, a swap file or a partition, a start-up target, a watched file system path, a timer controlled and supervised by systemd . systemd => a resource management slice, or a group of externally created processes. systemctl list-unit-files lists all unit files You can grep to see just the enabled services. $ systemctl list-unit-files | grep enabled $ systemctl list-unit-files | grep disabled Example Output Below Unit File State Vendor Preset proc-sys-fs-binfmt_misc.mount disabled enabled acpid.service disabled enabled brltty.service disabled enabled console-getty.service disabled disabled debug-shell.service disabled disabled fwupd-refresh.service static disabled openvpn3-autoload.service disabled enabled These unit files, located under /lib/systemd/system , are roughly the equivalent to the legacy init scripts that were located under /etc/rc.d/init.d .

If it is showing as disbled, then you can run sudo systemctl enable docker If it is not started, then you can run sudo systemctl start docker To confirm that Docker is working, you can run sudo docker run hello-world To make sure that you don't always have to run commands with sudo , you can do sudo usermod -aG docker <userid> Restart system after adding yourself to the Docker group. Part 4 - Running Containers docker images => will show you all available images on your machine. Since we ran the hello-world image in the previous step, the docker image should be listed in the results. docker search <imagename> => will show you all available images with the name ubuntu docker pull <imagename> => will download the image docker run <imagename> = will run the image you want to create your container in Note if you run a container and there is nothing for it to do, then it will just exit. For example, if you just type docker run ubuntu , then nothing will happen because you did not tell it do anything. docker ps => list of Docker images running on your machine. docker ps -a => list of Docker images that have been run on your machine. To attempt to keep a container running, you can run => docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash it => i stands for interactive; t stands for tty or terminal Part 5 - Making Containers Persist Using the same command as above => docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash Add -d to keep it running in the background => docker run -it -d ubuntu /bin/bash -d stands for daemon (a service running in the background) To confirm the container is still running, run docker ps Results :CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES b677c09360ba ubuntu \"/bin/bash\" 3 minutes ago Up 3 minutes naughty_jones How to attach yourselft to a container => docker attach <containerID> Results : prompt changes to root@<containerID> How to exit a container while leaving the container running => Ctrl+pq Part 6 - Accessing Containerized Applications Let's try running a different container => docker run nginx Nginx is a proxy and web server docker run -it -d -p 8080:80 nginx -p means port Here we are opening port 8080 on our host computer and opening port 80 on the docker container. Then, do docker ps to make sure that your container is running. Since nginx is a webserver, you can type <ipaddress of host>:8080 in to a browser, and you will see the nginx main screen popup. Any computer on your network should be able to bring up the webpage. To see the Nginx container running do a docker ps To stop the container from running you can do => docker stop <containerID> Now do => docker run -it -d --restart unless-stopped -p 8080:80 nginx The restart unless-stopped is very helpful so you can do a Ctrl+C without stopping the container from running. Part 7: Creating Images Last video in the series. Create an Ubuntu image docker run -it ubuntu apt update apt dist-upgrade apt install apache2 To see if apache is running => /etc/init.d/apache2 status To start it => /etc/init.d/apache2 start Let's install vim => apt install vim-nox Now, lets save all of these changes, so we do not lose them. Do, docker ps to obtain the Container ID. Then, do docker commit <containerID> <newname>:<versioninfo> My example => docker commit 5db0e25d6ca0 ubuntu/apache-test:1.0 You receive a sha256 hash. Then do docker images and you should see your image listed. Now, lets stop everything and go back in and see if we can still get to our image. docker stop <containerID> Do docker ps to make sure nothing is running. Since you have confirmed nothing is running, lets try to locate and use our image we created earlier. docker run -d -it -p 8080:80 <imagename> For my example, it would be docker run -d -it -p 8080:80 ubuntu/apache-test:1.0 Do docker ps Since it is running, lets bring up a webpage, using same webpage we used earlier, which was <IPaddress:8080> Doh, it does not work. Why? Because Apache is not running, as we did not create an entry point. Lets add an entry point => docker commit --change='ENTRYPOINT [\"apachectl\", \"-DFOREGROUND\"]' c26 ubuntu/apache-test:1.1 Receive SHA256 hash again Do docker images You should see both of your images Do docker ps to see your running containers Stop the original container that is still running => docker stop <containerID> Then recall the last command via the up arrow, just change the version from 1.0 to 1.1. Hit enter. Do docker ps to see insure your image is running. Now, lets try to bring up the webpage again. You should now see the Apache2 Default page. Now, lets automate this entire process by creating text file, known as a docker file docker build -t ubuntu/apache-test:1.2 . DockerFile To remove Docker images => docker rmi <imageID> To remove Docker containers => docker rm <containerID> If you are receiving messages that state you are unable to remove an image because a container is using it, then do docker ps -a or docker ps -a | grep <containerID> .
