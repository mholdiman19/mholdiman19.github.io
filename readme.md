# ReadMyDocs

I created this site to organize and backup commands, documentation and anything else I want to have accessible. Please note that I attempted to give credit where applicable and this site is constantly updated. Needless to say, sections are not exhaustive and are my notes while reading, watching videos or on-the-job experience and learning. Thank you!
